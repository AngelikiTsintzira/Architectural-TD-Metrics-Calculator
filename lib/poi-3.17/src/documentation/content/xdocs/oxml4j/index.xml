          <title>Overview</title>
          <p>OpenXML4J is the POI Project's pure Java implementation of the Open Packaging Conventions (OPC) defined in 
            <link href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm">ECMA-376</link>.</p>
          <p>Every OpenXML file comprises a collection of byte streams called parts, combined into a container called a package. 
            POI OpenXML4J provides a physical implementation of the OPC that uses the Zip file format.</p>

          <p>OpenXML4J was originally developed by
            <link href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090611063015/http://www.openxml4j.org/">openxml4j.org</link>,
            and was contributed to Apache POI in 2008. The original code is available at
              <link href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/openxml4j/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/openxml4j/</link>.
