            <title>POI-HSLF</title>

            <p>HSLF is the POI Project's pure Java implementation of the Powerpoint '97(-2007) file format. </p>
    <p>HSLF provides a way to read, create or modify PowerPoint  presentations. In particular, it provides:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>api for data extraction (text, pictures, embedded objects, sounds)</li>
                <li>usermodel api for creating, reading and modifying ppt files</li>
            </ul>
         <note> 
            This code currently lives the 
            <link href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/poi/trunk/src/scratchpad/">scratchpad area</link> 
            of the POI SVN repository. To use this component, ensure
            you have the Scratchpad Jar on your classpath, or a dependency
            defined on the <em>poi-scratchpad</em> artifact - the main POI
            jar is not enough! See the
            <link href="/overview.html#components">POI Components Map</link>
            for more details.
			</note>
			<p>The <link href="./quick-guide.html">quick guide</link> documentation provides 
            information on using this API. Comments and fixes gratefully accepted on the POI
            dev mailing lists.</p>

            <title>POI-XSLF</title>
            <p>
            XSLF is the POI Project's pure Java implementation of the PowerPoint 2007 OOXML (.xlsx) file format. 
            Whilst HSLF and XSLF provide similar features, there is not a common interface across the two of them at this time.
            </p>
            <p>
            Please note that XSLF is still in early development and is a subject to incompatible changes in future. 
            </p>
            <p>
              A quick guide is available in the <link href="./xslf-cookbook.html">XSLF Cookbook</link>
