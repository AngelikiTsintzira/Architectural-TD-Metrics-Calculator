        <section><title>Basic Text Extraction</title>
        <p>For basic text extraction, make use of 
<code>org.apache.poi.hslf.extractor.PowerPointExtractor</code>. It accepts a file or an input
stream. The <code>getText()</code> method can be used to get the text from the slides, and the <code>getNotes()</code> method can be used to get the text
from the notes. Finally, <code>getText(true,true)</code> will get the text
from both.
		</p>
		</section>
		
		<section><title>Specific Text Extraction</title>
		<p>To get specific bits of text, first create a <code>org.apache.poi.hslf.usermodel.HSLFSlideShow</code>
(from a <code>org.apache.poi.hslf.usermodel.HSLFSlideShowImpl</code>, which accepts a file or an input
stream). Use <code>getSlides()</code> and <code>getNotes()</code> to get the slides and notes.
These can be queried to get their page ID (though they should be returned
in the right order).</p>
		<p>You can then call <code>getTextParagraphs()</code> on these, to get 
their blocks of text. (A list of <code>HSLFTextParagraph</code> normally holds all the text in a 
given area of the page, eg in the title bar, or in a box).
From the <code>HSLFTextParagraph</code>, you can extract the text, and check
what type of text it is (eg Body, Title). You can also call
<code>getTextRuns()</code>, which will return the 
<code>HSLFTextRun</code>s that make up the <code>TextParagraph</code>. A 
<code>HSLFTextRun</code> is a text fragment, having the same character formatting.
The paragraph formatting is defined in the parent <code>HSLFTextParagraph</code>.
		</p>
		</section>
		
        <section><title>Poor Quality Text Extraction</title>
        <p>If speed is the most important thing for you, you don't care
		about getting duplicate blocks of text, you don't care about 
		getting text from master sheets, and you don't care about getting
		old text, then 
		<code>org.apache.poi.hslf.extractor.QuickButCruddyTextExtractor</code>
		might be of use.</p>
		<p>QuickButCruddyTextExtractor doesn't use the normal record 
		parsing code, instead it uses a tree structure blind search 
		method to get all text holding records. You will get all the text,
		including lots of text you normally wouldn't ever want. However,
		you will get it back very very fast!</p>
		<p>There are two ways of getting the text back. 
		<code>getTextAsString()</code> will return a single string with all
		the text in it. <code>getTextAsVector()</code> will return a 
		vector of strings, one for each text record found in the file.
		</p>
		</section>

		<section><title>Changing Text</title>
		<p>It is possible to change the text via 
		<code>HSLFTextParagraph.setText(List&lt;HSLFTextParagraph&gt;,String)</code> or
		<code>HSLFTextRun.setText(String)</code>. It is possible to add additional TextRuns
        with <code>HSLFTextParagraph.appendText(List&lt;HSLFTextParagraph&gt;,String,boolean)</code>
         or <code>HSLFTextParagraph.addTextRun(HSLFTextRun)</code></p>
		<p>When calling <code>HSLFTextParagraph.setText(List&lt;HSLFTextParagraph&gt;,String)</code>, all
		the text will end up with the same formatting. When calling
		<code>HSLFTextRun.setText(String)</code>, the text will retain
		the old formatting of that <code>HSLFTextRun</code>.
		</p>
		</section>

		<section><title>Adding Slides</title>
		<p>You may add new slides by calling
		<code>HSLFSlideShow.createSlide()</code>, which will add a new slide
		to the end of the SlideShow. It is possible to re-order slides with <code>HSLFSlideShow.reorderSlide(...)</code>.
		</p>
		</section>
		
		<section><title>Guide to key classes</title>
		<ul>
		<li><code>org.apache.poi.hslf.usermodel.HSLFSlideShowImpl</code>
		Handles reading in and writing out files. Calls 
		<code>org.apache.poi.hslf.record.record</code> to build a tree
		of all the records in the file, which it allows access to.
  		</li>
		<li><code>org.apache.poi.hslf.record.Record</code>
		Base class of all records. Also provides the main record generation
		code, which will build up a tree of records for a file.
  		</li>
  		<li><code>org.apache.poi.hslf.usermodel.HSLFSlideShow</code>
  Builds up model entries from the records, and presents a user facing
  view of the file
  		</li>
  		<li><code>org.apache.poi.hslf.usermodel.HSLFSlide</code>
  A user facing view of a Slide in a slideshow. Allows you to get at the
  Text of the slide, and at any drawing objects on it.
  		</li>
  		<li><code>org.apache.poi.hslf.usermodel.HSLFTextParagraph</code>
  A list of <code>HSLFTextParagraph</code>s holds all the text in a given area of the Slide, and will
  contain one or more <code>HSLFTextRun</code>s.
  		</li>
  		<li><code>org.apache.poi.hslf.usermodel.HSLFTextRun</code>
  Holds a run of text, all having the same character stylings. It is possible to modify text, and/or text stylings.
  		</li>
  		<li><code>org.apache.poi.hslf.extractor.PowerPointExtractor</code>
  Uses the model code to allow extraction of text from files
		</li>
		<li><code>org.apache.poi.hslf.extractor.QuickButCruddyTextExtractor</code>
  Uses the record code to extract all the text from files very fast, 
  but including deleted text (and other bits of Crud).
		</li>
		</ul>
