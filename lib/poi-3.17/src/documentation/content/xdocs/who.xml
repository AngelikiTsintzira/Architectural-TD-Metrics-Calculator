 <section><title>Apache POI - Who we are</title>
  <p>
    The Apache POI Project operates on a meritocracy: the more you do, the more
    responsibility you will obtain. This page lists all of the people who have
    gone the extra mile and are Committers. If you would like to get involved,
    the first step is to join the <link href="mailinglists.html">mailing lists</link>.
  </p>

  <p>
    We ask that you please do not send us emails privately asking for support.
    We are non-paid volunteers who help out with the project and we do not
    necessarily have the time or energy to help people on an individual basis.
    The <link href="mailinglists.html">mailing lists</link> have many individuals
    who will help answer detailed requests for help. The benefit of
    using mailing lists over private communication is that they are a shared
    resource where others can also learn from common questions.
  </p>
  <p>
    POI Developers count on feedback from the mailing lists. Many developers do take
    an active role on the lists.

 <section><title>I want some progress on a bug report!</title>
  <p>
      So you took the time to report a bug, provided information that should make
      it possible to reproduce the problem and fix it. Surely the fix is easy and
      should take a seasoned developer a few minutes at max to fix!

      So why is there no progress on your bug report? Is there nobody
      taking care when your problem is clearly stopping nearly everybody
      from using POI?

      We know that the absence of responses on bug-reports can be frustrating,
      sometimes bugs lie dormant for a long time for no apparent reason.

      Please always remember: <em>nobody is paid to work on POI</em>, the team is
      a bunch of volunteers who look at things in their free time.

      Because of that developers might choose to work on things based on a
      different priority than yours! Especially the quality and maturity of
      bug reports will affect if somebody decides to look at it.

      So the best way to help a bug report see progress is to provide more information
      if available or supply patches together with unit-tests.

      If you can, look at <link href="guidelines.html">Contribution Guidelines</link>
      for more information about providing patches.
