            <p>HSMF is the POI Project's pure Java implementation of the Outlook MSG format.</p>
            <p>At this time, it provides low-level read access to all of the file, along
			    with a user-facing way to get at the common textual content of MSG files.
             to all</p>
            <p>There is an example MSG textual renderer, which shows how to access the
             common parts such as sender, subject, message body and examples. This is
             in the 
                <link href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/poi/trunk/src/examples/src/org/apache/poi/hsmf/examples/">HSMF examples area</link> 
             of SVN. You may also wish to look at the unit tests for more use guides.</p>

         <note> 
            This code currently lives the 
            <link href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/poi/trunk/src/scratchpad/">scratchpad area</link> 
            of the POI SVN repository. To use this component, ensure
            you have the Scratchpad Jar on your classpath, or a dependency
            defined on the <em>poi-scratchpad</em> artifact - the main POI
            jar is not enough! See the
            <link href="/overview.html#components">POI Components Map</link>
            for more details.
			</note>
         <note>
            This code is subject to change between versions, and being
            "scratchpad", doesn't maintain the usual Apache POI backwards
            compatibility guarantees. In particular, the way that property
            values are fetched is expected to change soon, as part of the
            work to improve fixed-length property support.
