            <title>Overview</title>

            <p>HPBF is the POI Project's pure Java implementation of the 
			  Publisher file format.</p>
            <p>Currently, HPBF is in an early stage, whilst we try to
              figure out the file format. So far, we have basic text
              extraction support, and are able to read some parts within
              the file. Writing is not yet supported, as we are unable
              to make sense of the Contents stream, which we think has
              lots of offsets to other parts of the file.</p>
            <p>Our initial aim is to produce a text extractor for the format
              (now done), and be able to extract hyperlinks from within
              the document (partly supported). Additional low level
              code to process the file format may follow, if there
              is demand and developer interest warrants it.</p>
            <p>Text Extraction is available via the 
              <em>org.apache.poi.hpbf.extractor.PublisherTextExtractor</em>
              class.</p>
            <p>At this time, there is no <em>usermodel</em> api or similar.
              There is only low level support for certain parts of
              the file, but by no means all of it.</p>
            <p>Our current understanding of the file format is documented
              <link href="file-format.html">here</link>.</p>
            <p>As of 2017, we are unaware of a public format specification for
              Microsoft Publisher .pub files. This format was not included in
              the Microsoft Open Specifications Promise with the rest of the
              Microsoft Office file formats.
              As of <link href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/63dc6c4e-d6b2-4873-97dd-139ddb304e24/what-about-publisher-file-format?forum=os_binaryfile">2009</link> and <link href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/a5f55c72-5378-4dc9-944a-9973a12bfaa7/reading-viso-vsdfiles-and-publisher-pubfiles-without-office?forum=os_binaryfile">2016</link>, Microsoft had no plans to document the .pub file format.
              If this changes in the future, perhaps we will see a spec published
              on the <link href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc313105(v=office.12).aspx">Microsoft Office File Format Open Specification Technical Documentation</link>.
            </p>

         <note> 
            This code currently lives the 
            <link href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/poi/trunk/src/scratchpad/">scratchpad area</link> 
            of the POI SVN repository. To use this component, ensure
            you have the Scratchpad Jar on your classpath, or a dependency
            defined on the <em>poi-scratchpad</em> artifact - the main POI
            jar is not enough! See the
            <link href="/overview.html#components">POI Components Map</link>
            for more details.
